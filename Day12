Unique Pairs

Mrs. Frizzle is beginning to plan lessons for her science class next semester, and wants to encourage friendship amongst her students.
To accomplish her goal, Mrs. Frizzle will ensure each student has a chance to partner with every other student in the class in a series of science projects.

Mrs. Frizzle does not know who will be in her class next semester, but she does know she will have n students total in her class.

Solution:
function projectPartners(n) {
x=0;
y=0;
i=0;
if(n%2===0){
  x = n/2
  y = n-1
  i = x*y
  return i
  }else{
  x = n*(n-1)
  y = x/2 
  return y
  }
}
