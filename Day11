The museum of incredible dull things
The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. 
Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. 
She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, 
so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

Solution: 


function removeSmallest(numbers) {
	var indexOfSmallest = 0;
	var smallestNumber = numbers[0];
  
	for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  
		if (numbers[i] < smallestNumber) {
			smallestNumber = numbers[i];
			indexOfSmallest = i;
		}
	}
	numbers.splice(indexOfSmallest, 1);
	return numbers;
}
